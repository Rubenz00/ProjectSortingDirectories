# ProjectSortingDirectories
code to organize any directory in its file type. For instance, photos of the file type ".jpg" are all in one folder and photos of the type ".png" are all sorted in another folder.

To use, just chage the SUBDIRECTORIES dictionary into the folders you want to make and the type of files they are going to contain.

Remember to have the Organizer.py file in the directory you want to organize
